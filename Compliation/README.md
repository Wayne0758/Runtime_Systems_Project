- Python libraries: numpy, matplotlib (for chart generation)

### Running with Script
1. Grant execution permission to the script:
   ```
   chmod +x run_compilation_tests.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   ./run_compilation_tests.sh

## Test Metrics

This test collects and analyzes the following performance metrics:

1. **Execution Time (ms)**: Total time required to complete a specified number of iterations
2. **Time Per Call (ns)**: Average time for a single function call
3. **JIT Warm-up Time**: Time required for the Java JIT compiler to reach stable performance
5. **Performance Improvement After Warm-up**: Percentage difference in performance before and after warm-up

### Kotlin Inline Function Analysis

Kotlin's inline functions perform differently compared to normal functions in various scenarios:

| Test Type            | Inline Time (ms) | Normal Time (ms) | Improvement (%) |
|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Simple Arithmetic    | 5.87            | 3.17             | -46.01         |
| Higher-Order Func    | 6.31            | 11.21            | 77.84          |
| Calls Within Loops   | 7.20            | 2.92             | -59.39         |
| Nested Inline        | 3.61            | 1.91             | -47.18         |
| Complex Condition    | 18.37           | 22.83            | 24.30          |
| Generic Function     | 6.87            | 33.62            | 389.09         |

## Generated Charts
The test generates the following analysis charts:
- `java_warmup_analysis.png`: Java JIT warm-up curves for different function types
- `java_kotlin_inline_comparison.png`: Comparison of Java and Kotlin execution times
- `kotlin_performance_analysis.png`: Comparison of Kotlin inline vs. normal function performance

## Conclusion

1. The Java JIT compiler significantly improves performance after warm-up, especially for higher-order functions and nested functions.
2. Kotlin's inline functions show the most significant advantages in higher-order functions, complex condition and generic functions scenarios.
3. For simple arithmetic functions, both Java JIT optimization and Kotlin inline optimization show minimal effects, and may even have negative impacts.
4. The number of warm-up iterations has little impact on the performance of simple functions in both Java and Kotlin, but may negatively affect Kotlin inline functions.

## Note on Kotlin Inline Function Warnings

When compiling Kotlin code, you may see the following warning:

```
warning: expected performance impact from inlining is insignificant. Inlining works best for functions with parameters of function types.
inline fun inlineAdd(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b
```

This warning indicates that the Kotlin compiler believes using inline for simple arithmetic functions may not provide significant performance improvements. This aligns with our experimental results: in simple arithmetic and loop call scenarios, inline functions actually perform worse than normal functions.

Kotlin's inline functions are primarily designed to optimize higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as parameters), where inlining indeed provides significant performance improvements. This further confirms that inline functions should be used in appropriate scenarios rather than applied blindly to all functions.

To suppress this warning, you can use the `@Suppress("NOTHING_TO_INLINE")` annotation.
